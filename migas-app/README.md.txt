# In Intellij :
- [ ] Open up IntelliJ and click File => New => Project
- [ ] On the left panel, select Scala. On the right panel, select IDEA.
- [ ] Name the project 
- [ ] Assuming this is your first time creating a Scala project with IntelliJ, you’ll need to install a Scala SDK.  - [ ] To the right of the Scala SDK field, click the Create button.
- [ ] Select the highest version number (e.g. 2.13.0) and click Download. This might take a few minutes but subsequent projects can use the same SDK.
- [ ] Once the SDK is created and you’re back to the “New Project” window click Finish.
